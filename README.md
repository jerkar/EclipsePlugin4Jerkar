# An Eclipse plugin to for Jerkar

As pure java tool, Jerkar does not need specific tooling to be used kindly in an IDE. Neverthless, some task as scaffolding projectd or updating classpath 
are welcome to be integrated in IDE menu for even better user experience.

For now, this plugin provide a "Jerkar" menu extension when right clicling on a project :

* Update classpath : this will align Eclipse .classpath with the dependencies declared in Jerkar for the concerned project.
* Scaffold projects : this will create folder structure along a basic build class for starting up projects.
